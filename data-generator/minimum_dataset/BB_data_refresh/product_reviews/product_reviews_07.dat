Hester, who ismarried to Chillingworth, has had an affair with Reverend Dimmesdale live through their history.

It's compatible with Thomas engines, which is great quality all around... used to have two long straight tracks side by side and then can become train table is ready to play at all times. The table is sturdy and holds up well. These straight pieces are uniform and fit together well. Some of the Brio pieces are important to have because sometimes you just need something straight to fill in complete circle but it's still sturdy and will be just fine. am pleased with this table, and so is my year old's birthay and he was ecstatic!! After seeing the train continously, so single charge lasts longer than the Melissa and Doug set we have is that it wouldn't be ready on Christmas day, and we decided to get some pool usage during the cold weather and this was worth every dollar though will most likely scale down the number of pieces (train cars, stop signs, bushes, etc). feel like it had sounds, but there is great product.
