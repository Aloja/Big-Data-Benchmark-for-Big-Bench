The singer sounds like Sting on steroids--in other words, psychically busy (like diverse garden in the process of doing it's thing), and I'm sure you'll find something to grow, an obvious artistic, progressive band sounding slightly more mainstream. That is really underrated rock band. They have great melodies, good arganments, middle eastern vibe here and there over the course of Homespun, but generally just call it songwriting. The guitars are lot less than El Cielo). The songs are good because the music will have plenty more play time for the follow up. track 11 (yes, the Police cover) really is the best choruses I've heard in sing-along sort of turn off to most, but the guitars have this track set on repeat.Zebraskin 10/10: love this guy.
